## 1. Introduction

### What is Aifya?

Aifya is an AI-native Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) purpose-built for Kenyan hospitals. It manages the complete hospital workflow — from patient registration through billing — across 49 integrated modules. What sets Aifya apart is deep AI integration: ambient clinical documentation (ScribeAI), automated insurance claims (ClaimFlow), clinical trial screening, predictive analytics, and medical imaging analysis.

### Key Capabilities

- **49 clinical and administrative modules** covering the full hospital workflow
- **AI-native architecture** with self-hosted language models (no cloud AI dependency)
- **Offline-first design** — core clinical workflows function without internet
- **Bilingual interface** — English and Swahili (Kiswahili) throughout
- **FHIR R4 compliant** — standards-based health data exchange
- **Kenya-specific** — M-Pesa payments, SHA insurance, MOH reporting, DHIS2 sync
- **Multi-tenant** — one installation supports multiple facilities with strict data isolation
- **Event-sourced clinical data** — immutable audit trail with 20-year retention

### Who Should Read This Manual?

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

Every piece of data in Aifya is tagged with a `facility_id`. When a user logs in, their facility is embedded in their authentication token. Every database query automatically filters by this facility, ensuring:

- **No data leaks** between facilities sharing the same installation
- **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** as defense-in-depth
- **Audit trail** tracking which user at which facility accessed what data

---

## 3. Getting Started

## 7. AI-Powered Features

> **Enterprise and Government tiers only.** AI features require the `ai_features` flag.

### Clinical Safety Guarantee

**AI never auto-commits to patient records.** Every AI-generated suggestion, prediction, or analysis requires explicit clinician sign-off before being saved to the patient chart. This is a non-negotiable safety requirement.

### AI Model Routing

Aifya uses self-hosted models with automatic routing based on task complexity:

| Complexity | Model | Port | Use Cases |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Simple | Qwen 3.5 72B | 8002 | Template filling, simple Q&A |
| Medium | Distill-32B | 8003 | Summaries, translations |

## 9. Offline-First Operation

Aifya is designed to work without internet connectivity — critical for many Kenyan health facilities.

### How It Works

1. **Data Caching:** All data fetched from the server is cached locally in the browser's IndexedDB
2. **Offline Mutations:** When you create or update data while offline, changes are queued locally
3. **Auto-Sync:** When connectivity returns, queued changes sync automatically
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Server data takes priority; conflicts are logged for review

### What Works Offline
- Patient registration
- Vital signs recording
- Prescription writing
- Diagnosis entry
- Basic billing
- Viewing cached patient records

### What Requires Connectivity
- AI features (ScribeAI, CDS, Analytics, Imaging)
- M-Pesa payments
- SMS/WhatsApp sending
- DHIS2 submission
- FHIR data exchange
- Real-time queue updates from other devices

### Visual Indicator
An offline badge appears in the UI when connectivity is lost. A "Syncing..." indicator shows when queued changes are being uploaded.

---

## 10. Clinical Safety Protocols

### Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **AI Never Auto-Commits**
   Every AI suggestion — ScribeAI extractions, CDS alerts, agent workflow outputs, imaging analysis — requires explicit clinician review and sign-off before being recorded in the patient chart.

2. **Drug Interaction Checks**
   Before any prescription is saved, the CDS engine checks for drug-drug interactions, allergy cross-reactions, pregnancy contraindications, and dosage safety. **Critical interactions block the save** until the clinician provides an override reason.

3. **Critical Lab Values**
   When a lab result falls in the panic/critical range, an immediate notification is sent to the ordering physician. This alert cannot be silenced until acknowledged.

4. **Serious Adverse Events (Clinical Trials)**
   SAEs must be reportable to the trial sponsor within 24 hours. The system generates pre-filled CIOMS forms via AI.

5. **Audit Trail**
   All clinical data uses event sourcing — every change creates an immutable event record. No clinical data can be truly deleted (soft-delete only). This provides a complete audit trail for regulatory compliance, with 20-year retention.

6. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
   Every database query is filtered by facility_id. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security provides defense-in-depth. Cross-facility data access is architecturally impossible.

## 12. Administration Guide

### Environment Configuration

All configuration is managed via environment variables (`.env` file). Key settings:

#### Database
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/aifya
```

#### Authentication
```bash
KEYCLOAK_URL=http://keycloak:8080
KEYCLOAK_REALM=aifya
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=aifya-web
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
```

#### AI Models
```bash
VLLM_DEEPSEEK_R1_URL=http://ai-gpu:8001/v1
VLLM_QWEN_72B_URL=http://ai-gpu:8002/v1
VLLM_DISTILL_32B_URL=http://ai-gpu:8003/v1
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://ai-service:8025
```

#### External Services
```bash
# M-Pesa
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=key
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=secret
MPESA_SHORTCODE=123456
MPESA_ENVIRONMENT=production

# DHIS2
DHIS2_BASE_URL=https://hiskenya.org
DHIS2_USERNAME=user
DHIS2_PASSWORD=pass

# Communications
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=key
AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=username
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=phone_id
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
cd services/api-gateway && alembic upgrade head

# Create a new migration after model changes
cd services/api-gateway && alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add new table"

# Rollback last migration
cd services/api-gateway && alembic downgrade -1
```

**Important:** Never drop columns in migrations. Use `is_deprecated` flag instead.

### User Management

Users are managed in Keycloak:

1. Access Keycloak admin console (`http://localhost:8080`)
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Select the `aifya` realm
4. **Create User:** Users > Add User > Set username, email, first/last name
5. **Set Password:** Credentials tab > Set password > Disable "Temporary"
6. **Assign Roles:** Role Mappings > Add realm roles
7. **Set Facility:** Attributes tab > Add `facility_id` attribute with facility UUID

### Backup & Recovery

```bash
# Database backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U aifya_user aifya > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# MinIO backup (documents, images)
mc mirror minio/aifya-documents ./backup-documents/

# Restore database
psql -h localhost -U aifya_user aifya < backup_20260410.sql
```

### Monitoring

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Grafana | http://localhost:3001 | Dashboards and alerts |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | Metrics collection |
| Loki | (via Grafana) | Log aggregation |
| Tempo | (via Grafana) | Distributed tracing |

## 13. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "You are offline" banner won't go away
- Check your network connection
- Try refreshing the browser
- Clear IndexedDB cache: DevTools > Application > IndexedDB > Delete database

#### Login fails with "Session Expired"
- Keycloak tokens expire after configurable period (default 30 minutes)
- Click the login button to re-authenticate
- If persistent, check Keycloak server status

#### CDS alerts not appearing
- Ensure the `encounters` module is licensed
- Check that the CDS engine service is running
- Verify patient has allergies/medications recorded for interaction checking

#### M-Pesa STK Push not received
- Verify phone number is in correct format (07XX or +254XX)
- Check MPESA_ENVIRONMENT matches your credentials (sandbox vs production)
- Ensure callback URL is publicly accessible
- Check M-Pesa status: GET `/api/v1/mpesa/status`

#### MOH reports show zero data
- Verify the date range covers a period with clinical activity
- Ensure diagnoses have ICD-10 codes assigned
- Check that encounter types are correctly categorized (outpatient vs inpatient)

#### AI features return "service unavailable"
- Verify vLLM model servers are running on ports 8001-8003
- Check GPU memory — large models need A100 80GB
- Review ai-service logs: `docker logs aifya-ai-service`

#### Slow performance
- Check Redis is running (caching reduces database load)
- Monitor PostgreSQL connections: too many concurrent queries may need pool tuning
- Review Grafana dashboards for resource bottlenecks
